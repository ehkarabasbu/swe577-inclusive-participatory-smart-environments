**Advisor:** Assistant Professor Suzan Üsküdarlı
**Student:** Emir Hüseyin Karabaş
**Term:** Fall 2025

## 1. Research Overview

This repository documents the research process for the SWE 577 term paper, which investigates a software-driven approach to creating inclusive and participatory smart environments across building, urban, and national scales. 

The research focuses on extracting SWE architectural patterns and insights, particularly at the intersection of SWE and BIM, using open standards (IFC/IDS) and open-source practices.
